{"body":"A jQuery plugin which update automagically the fuzzy dates (`X seconds ago` etc) in your application.\r\n\r\nFeatures :\r\n- Ability to change the translation table.\r\n- Accept custom steps\r\n- Work \r\n- *Does not leak*\r\n\r\nIf you add new datefuzz elements into your DOM, they will be fuzzified at the next update without more pain. And when you will remove these elements, they won't be called anymore. No user code required.\r\n\r\nOh, and if you don't use the auto-update ... then there won't be any timer on your web page. Can't really lower the footprint, right ?\r\n\r\n### API\r\n\r\n#### $.datefuzz( container )\r\n\r\nAdds a new datefuzz container to the update list.\r\n\r\nNote that if you want to make it easy, you can just add `$.datefuzz( 'body' )` somewhere and you're done.\r\n\r\n#### $.datefuzz( option, value )\r\n\r\n`option` can be any value among :\r\n\r\n* **debug** (true / false), true means that datefuzz will warn you if you try to fuzzify a non-`time` element (default false)\r\n* **interval** (integer), which contains the number of milliseconds between each update (default 1000)\r\n* **selector**, which specify the Sizzle selector which will be automatically updated in the selected containers (default `.-datefuzz`)\r\n* **table**, which contains a translation table. Please see the source file for an example. Feel free to open pull requests for adding language tables to the repository\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div id=\"-my-fuzzy-container\"></div>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\n    $.datefuzz( '#-my-fuzzy-container' );\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<!-- Wanna test ? -->\r\n<script>\r\n    window.setInterval( function ( ) {\r\n        $( '<time/>' )\r\n\r\n            // Note : the dateFormat function is not standard, but javascript's Date object\r\n            // is not compatible with the HTML5 Datetime property. What a shame :(\r\n            .attr( 'datetime', dateFormat( new Date( ), 'yyyy-mm-dd\"T\"hh:MM:ssoD' ) )\r\n\r\n            // Totally optional. Calling this allow to force the fuzzyfication rather than\r\n            // waiting for the next update. You can call $.datefuzz() too, but it will update\r\n            // every fuzzy date, which should be overkilled.\r\n            .datefuzz( )\r\n\r\n        .appendTo( '#-my-fuzzy-container' );\r\n    }, 1000 );\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nThe `$.datefuzz` function is meant to be used on containers, and definitely not on datefuzz elements (if you do so your application will leak. It would probably be noticeable too, since the elements would not be fuzzified :).\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\n    * -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n    * \"THE BEER/PIZZA-WARE LICENSE\" (Revision 42):\r\n    * <nison.mael@gmail.com> wrote these files.
